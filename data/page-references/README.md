The purpose of the files here is to provide an easy way to copy-paste pages titles into
the Wikipedia's export page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Export) which generates
XML extracts of the pages requested.

The `all-verbs-references.txt` file contains a collection of all the references, regardless
of the verb's starting letter, while the rest of the files are first-letter-based for ease
of batching out the exports.
